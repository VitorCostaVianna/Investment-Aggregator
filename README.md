# Investment Aggregator  
## Overview  
This project is a simple investment aggregator that integrates with the [Brazilian stock exchange API (brapi.dev)](https://brapi.dev/) using **OpenFeign**. It is built with **Spring Boot** and follows a structured architecture with **JPA relationships**, **JUnit with Mockito for testing**, **password encoding**, and **Docker** for containerization.  

## What You Will Learn  

### ðŸ”¹ Creating a Simple CRUD with Spring Boot  
The easiest way to make a CRUD using **Spring Boot** is by creating a **Repository** for the entity you want to manage. Most of the time, this is an interface that extends `JpaRepository`, like in the example below:  

```java
@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, UUID> {
}
```
### ðŸ”¹Writing Unit Tests with Mockito  

### The Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) Pattern  
Mockito allows you to **mock dependencies** to isolate business logic during unit testing. A well-structured approach to writing tests is the **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern**, which consists of three phases:  

1. **Arrange**: Set up the necessary conditions, create mock objects, and define expected behaviors.  
2. **Act**: Execute the method being tested.  
3. **Assert**: Verify that the actual output matches the expected result.  

### Example of a Unit Test with Mockito  
```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class AccountServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private AccountRepository accountRepository;

    @InjectMocks
    private AccountService accountService;

    @Test
    void shouldReturnAccountWhenExists() {
        // Arrange
        UUID accountId = UUID.randomUUID();
        Account mockAccount = new Account(accountId, "Investment Account");
        when(accountRepository.findById(accountId)).thenReturn(Optional.of(mockAccount));

        // Act
        Account result = accountService.getAccountById(accountId);

        // Assert
        assertNotNull(result);
        assertEquals(mockAccount.getDescription(), result.getDescription());
    }
}
```
####  Explanation of the Test
Arrange: We mock accountRepository and define behavior for findById().

Act: We call the getAccountById() method.

Assert: We check if the returned account matches expectations.

### Why Use Mockito?
âœ… Isolates business logic by removing database dependencies.

âœ… Improves test speed since it doesnâ€™t require a real database connection.

âœ… Allows behavior-driven testing, ensuring expected results for various scenarios.

Using Mockito, you can effectively test your Spring Boot services while keeping your tests fast, reliable, and independent from external dependencies. ðŸš€


## Features
  
- Fetch stock data(Price) via the [Brazilian stock exchange API](https://brapi.dev/).  
- Manage users, accounts, and stock holdings.  
- Secure authentication with password encoding.  
- Structured architecture: **Service, Controller, Entities, Repository, and Client layers**.  
- Unit tests with **JUnit and Mockito**.  
- Containerized with **Docker**.  


## Database Model  
The project follows a relational database design, as shown in the UML diagram:  
- **User** manages investment **Accounts**.  
- Each **Account** has a **Billing Address**.  
- Accounts hold multiple **Stocks** via a junction table (**Account_Stock**).
